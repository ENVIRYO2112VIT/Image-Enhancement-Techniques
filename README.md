# Image Enhancement Techniques

## Introduction
Done for an assignment given for the course of Image Processing.<br>
I attempt to process images of **Chest X-ray for COVID-19 detection**.

## Dataset and Images:
For the sample, I have uploaded 3 images of each category each- 
<ul>
<li><b><i>Covid,</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Normal</i></b> and</li>
<li><b><i>Virus</i></b>.</li><br><br>
</ul>

<p>The complete database can be accessed from the [COVID CXR Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/covid-cxr-image-dataset-research?resource=download "Go to kaggle.com for the referenced dataset")</p>

<br>

## References:
This implementation is based on the Image Enhancement techniques used and analysed from the paper:
